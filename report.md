# Findings report

This is the findings document for MLCryptoEngine. The validation harness
(`make validate`) appends a dated section below each time it runs. Human-written
analysis goes at the top of a dated section; machine-written metrics tables are
appended by `data/validate/`.

## Phase A acceptance criteria

Phase A is accepted when **all** of the following hold, measured by the validation
harness over recorded data:

1. A full day of Kraken data and a full day of Coinbase data each reconstruct through
   `data/book/` with **zero unexplained crossed-book events**. Crossed or locked books
   that coincide with a logged reconnect gap are explained; any other occurrence fails.
2. Valid-book coverage is **full-day outside logged reconnect gaps** — every second of
   the day is either covered by a valid book or attributable to a gap recorded in the
   recorder's `gaps.jsonl` sidecar.
3. Sequence validation reports **no unexplained sequence gaps** — every gap corresponds
   to a logged disconnect/reconnect window.
4. Reconstructed top-of-book agrees with venue-provided snapshots wherever the venue
   supplies them within tick-size tolerance.

## Measured results

The sections below are empty until data has been recorded and validated. Each
validation run appends a dated section with the measured values.
